I am working as a Lead Level Designer for YAGER GmbH based in Berlin. I have working 100% remotely for YAGER and I am currently based outside of Munich, Germany.

Currently my team and I are working together with Sharkmob on their next AAA Multiplayer Shooter called [Exoborne](https://www.exoborne.com/en/). I sadly can not yet reveal any 
details what we are working on, but once the game is out and in players hands I will be glad to talk more about what the team has accomplished on Exoborne. 

During my time at YAGER, this is what I have worked on: 

- An unnannounced mid-core mobile shooter that got cancelled before leaving prototyping.
- Mentored and led the YAGER Level Design time during our co-development with Funcom on [Dune: Awakening](https://duneawakening.com/)
  - Again, until the game is released I sadly am not able to share more details about our work on this title.
