I'm currently working as a Lead Level Designer for YAGER GmbH based in Berlin, but working 100% remotely from outside of Munich, Germany.

Right now I am working on Exoborne as the Lead Level Designer for the YAGER level designer. The main development studio behind Exoborne is Sharkmob (Sweden). I can not yet publicly talk about what I am working on for Exoborne, but will update this page as soon as the game is released. 

Before working with Sharkmob I was working on: 

- An unnannounced mid-core mobile shooter that sadly got cancelled
- Helped during our co-development with Funcom on Dune: Awakening
  - Again I can't talk too much about what we did until the game is publicly released.
