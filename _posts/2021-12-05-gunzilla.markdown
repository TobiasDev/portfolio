I worked as the Lead Level Designer for "[OFF THE GRID](https://playoffthegrid.com/)".

During my time at Gunzilla I helped build the first level design team, built the level design pipeline, and mentored several of our then junior and regular level designers. I 
was only part of the development during the very early stages while we where still prototyping different ideas, and level designs which none of them was planned for the final 
game.
