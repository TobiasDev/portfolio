I worked as a Senior Level Designer on the PvP-part called "Persistent Universe" (PU) in Star Citizen.

During my time at Cloud Imperium Games I worked on several of the now existing areas within the game. I started some locations from start to finish (planning, documentation, whitebox, greybox, final) and others I joined or helped other level designers work on. 


# Locations I worked on during my time at Star Citizen
## Surface Outposts
I worked on these from start to finish. The idea behind them was to build the smallest location we wanted within the PU and to make sure it was built with a modular set that we could easily expand on.

## Rest-stops
I worked on the original rest-stop design until it was taken over by another level designer when we began using an internal built modular tool.

## Area 18
I worked on this location from start to finish. One major difference with this location was that we already had en existing design that I had to keep in mind. I was allowed to do major changes to the location but needed to keep the original vision.

## Orison
I worked on this location from start until we reached greybox. Once we reached greybox I left the company to begin working at Gunzilla Games. 

# Other
Other things I worked on during my time at Star Citizen was: 

* The modular location tool
    * I did not own this, but was part of the process giving suggestions and feedback
* CitizenCon 2016
    * I was one of the level design owners of the PU demo we showed with Area 18 and Lorville
* CitizenCon 2019
    * I was one of the level designer owners and had to among other things design the "worm-hole"
